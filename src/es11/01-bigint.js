// What is bigint in JavaScript? and what is the difference between bigint and number?

// BigInt is a built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 253 - 1, which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive and represented by the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER constant. BigInt can be used for arbitrarily large integers.

const aBigNumber = 9007199254740991n;
const anotherBigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740991);
console.log(aBigNumber);
console.log(anotherBigNumber);
